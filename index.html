    <h1>Daniel Brink</h1>
    
    <p>As an Emergency Care Practitioner and lecturer, my day-to-day job is to teach and help new individuals develop in becoming independent and reflective healthcare practitioners. My key interests are in harnessing the capabilities of educational technologies like AI, game-based learning (and more) while aiming to be concious of maintaining that human connection in clinical education. I'm no expert, and well, would probably never be :), but I'm a self-driven and passionate individual, and innovator and pragmatist - always keeping busy to improve things around me.</p>

    <p>I love teaching, I love working with people, I love seeing lives changed. But realising that developing, identifying, enlighting an spark in someone else, can be more effective than I could humanly immagine. There is a greater good arround us. Thats what I belive.</p>
