    <h1>About me</h1>
    
    <p>As an Emergency Care Practitioner and lecturer, my day-to-day job is teaching and helping new individuals develop into independent and reflective healthcare practitioners. My key interests lie in harnessing the capabilities of educational technologies like AI and game-based learning, whilst being conscious of maintaining that human connection in clinical education. I'm no expert (and probably never will be!), but I'm a self-driven and passionate individual, an innovator and pragmatist - always keeping busy improving things around me.</p>

    <p>I love teaching, I love working with people, I love seeing lives changed. But I've realised that developing, identifying and igniting a spark in others can create impact beyond what I could humanly imagine. There is a greater good around us. That's what drives me.</p>
